# 📄 Product Requirements Document (PRD) – CityFlow

## Product Name
CityFlow – Smart City Event & Response Dashboard

## Owner
Karthik Mohan

## Version
v1.0

## Objective
To provide a unified, real-time dashboard for smart city stakeholders that integrates civic event data, traffic analytics, energy monitoring, and emergency coordination into a single interface — enabling faster, more informed decision-making.

---

## Background
Urban management suffers from siloed operations across departments. Emergency response, energy usage, and public alerts often exist on disconnected systems. CityFlow aims to integrate and visualize these functions under one platform for operational excellence.

---

## Target Users
- City Operations & Infrastructure Heads
- Emergency Response Coordinators
- Utility & Energy Monitoring Teams
- Policy & Planning Analysts

## Core Functional Requirements (MVP)

| Feature | Description | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| 📍 Event Aggregator | Ingest and classify real-time events from multiple sources (e.g., 911 calls, sensors) | Must Have |
| 🗺️ Interactive City Map | Show overlays of traffic, event pins, and alerts in real time | Must Have |
| ⚠️ Emergency Alert Trigger | Enable alert dispatch and broadcast per event type and authority level | Must Have |
| 💡 Energy Heatmap Layer | Visualize power usage by grid sector and detect outages | Should Have |
| 📈 Analytics Module | Allow playback of historic events, download reports | Could Have |

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- System latency for live data < 5 seconds
- Compliance with city data privacy standards
- Modular deployment for different city departments

---

## UX & Design Goals

- Map-first UX (mobile & desktop compatible)
- Low-clutter interface with dark/light mode
- Text accessibility (W3C AA compliant)

---

## Integrations
