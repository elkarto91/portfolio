### ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Due to the sensitive nature of grief, this product requires **cross-functional trust and slow cycles**.
- PM has directional ownership but must defer to **legal and emotional safety standards** in all feature development.

> In emotion-sensitive products, shared responsibility is more important than speed.
