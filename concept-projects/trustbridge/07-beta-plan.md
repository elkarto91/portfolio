# 🧪 Beta Plan – TrustBridge

The beta phase for TrustBridge will validate the technical integrity, usability, and audit readiness of its CLI, ledger integration, and compliance reporting — across real enterprise workflows.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Validate the CLI and webhook integrations across multiple transfer environments  
- Confirm ledger write consistency, hash integrity, and latency metrics  
- Gather structured feedback from security, DevOps, and compliance users  
- Pilot the JSON receipt format for internal and external audit readiness

---

## 🧑‍💼 Participants

- 3 enterprise teams:
  - Internal DevSecOps team with file movement pipelines
  - External audit compliance team (e.g., in finance or pharma)
  - Engineering partner for SDK integration

- Total ~30 users across 3 orgs:
  - Security leads, platform engineers, data stewards, legal observers

## 📊 Metrics to Capture

- 🧾 Number of successful logged transfers  
- ⏱️ Avg. time to anchor to blockchain (ledger latency)  
- 🔐 % of events with verified hash match  
- 👥 User satisfaction score on CLI usability + trust in output  
- ⚖️ Audit team rating of JSON receipts (clarity, completeness)

---

## 🧪 Feedback Tools

- Notion-form Beta Feedback Tracker  
- Weekly opt-in survey (CLI flow, error handling, perceived trust)  
- Optional 1:1 user interviews (15 mins each)

---

## 🔁 Iteration Process

- Feedback synthesized weekly  
- Roadmap updates sent to stakeholders after beta ends  
- CLI + JSON updates merged into v1.1 after validation

> Trust is built not just in blockchain, but in every line of developer experience and audit-readiness. This beta ensures both.
