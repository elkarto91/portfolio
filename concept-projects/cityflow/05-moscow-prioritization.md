# 🧩 MoSCoW Prioritization – CityFlow MVP

This table categorizes CityFlow's features using the MoSCoW method:  
**Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won’t Have (for now)**.

---

## ✅ Must Have (Critical for MVP)

| Feature | Justification |
|---------|---------------|
| Event Aggregator | Core to ingest and classify live civic events from 911, sensors, and feeds |
| Interactive Map Interface | Enables real-time spatial awareness and operator decisions |
| Emergency Alert Dispatch | Required to notify field units and escalate incidents |
| Basic User Roles (Ops/Admin) | Needed for access control between departments |
| Incident Logging | Base functionality to track events from report to resolution |

---

## 🟡 Should Have (Important but not critical for first release)

| Feature | Justification |
|---------|---------------|
| Energy Usage Overlay | Helps coordinate between outage and traffic situations |
| Historical Data Playback | Enables after-action reviews and planning analysis |
| Notification Center UI | Improves visibility of unseen or unattended events |
| Traffic Congestion Heatmap | Adds depth to incident context (e.g., ambulances rerouting) |

---

## 🔵 Could Have (Low-impact, nice-to-have)

| Feature | Justification |
|---------|---------------|
| Voice-based alert control | Useful for mobile ops, but not core to desktop dashboard |
| Slack/WhatsApp Integration | Adds convenience but not mandatory |
| Export as PDF/CSV | Functional bonus for planning or auditing |

---

## ❌ Won’t Have (Intentionally excluded from MVP)

| Feature | Reason for Deprioritization |
|---------|-----------------------------|
| Citizen Alert App | Requires complex permissions and legal review |
| ML-based Incident Prediction | Long-term roadmap item – not needed for MVP validation |
| Public Access to Real-Time Map | Requires extensive legal vetting and data masking |

> This prioritization was aligned with stakeholder interviews, technical feasibility, and pilot constraints for early adoption.
