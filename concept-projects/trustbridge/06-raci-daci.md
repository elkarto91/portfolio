## ðŸ’¬ Notes

- TrustBridge involves deeply cross-functional accountability â€” especially between **Security** and **Legal** teams.
- Product and Security jointly drive roadmap and MVP scope, but all launches must pass **legal sign-off** for data privacy and retention models.
- Future DACI will include external partners (marketplaces, auditors, etc.) once multi-org ledger mode is piloted.

> In trust infrastructure, design and compliance must co-own the product. Speed without sign-off is risk.
