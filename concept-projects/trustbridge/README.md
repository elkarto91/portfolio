# 🔐 TrustBridge – Blockchain-Powered Data Transfer Integrity for Enterprises

**Status:** Concept Project · Full Product Lifecycle · Created by Karthik Mohan

---

## 🎯 Summary

TrustBridge is a conceptual enterprise product that enhances the security and auditability of data movement across internal teams, clouds, and vendors. It overlays existing infrastructure with a blockchain-backed ledger for proof of transfer, enabling zero-trust enforcement, forensic traceability, and provable compliance.

---

## 🧠 Why TrustBridge?

- Enterprises struggle to prove where, how, and by whom sensitive data was accessed, copied, or transferred.
- Traditional logs (CloudTrail, SIEM, audit trails) are siloed, mutable, or require excessive trust.
- TrustBridge introduces **verifiable trust** by anchoring transfer events to a ledger — turning ephemeral movement into a provable record.
