# 📄 Business Case – CityFlow

## Project Overview
CityFlow is a smart city dashboard that unifies urban event alerts, traffic systems, energy usage data, and emergency response coordination into a single, intuitive platform. It addresses the increasing complexity of urban management and the growing demand for responsive, data-informed governance.

---

## Problem Statement
- **Siloed Systems:** City departments operate on separate tools and data streams, causing delays and inefficiencies.
- **No Central Command View:** Event data is scattered, making response coordination chaotic during peak demand.
- **Poor Transparency:** Public-facing accountability and engagement are limited due to lack of real-time visibility.

---

## Opportunity
- Governments are allocating increasing budgets to **smart city infrastructure**.
- Existing IoT infrastructure (traffic cameras, sensors, energy meters) can be repurposed via integrations.
- Public demand for **transparency and better service delivery** is higher than ever.
- Rising climate risk and urban density make **resilience and responsiveness** core public priorities.

---

## Solution
CityFlow will serve as:
- A **real-time situational dashboard** for city operations
- A **coordination hub** for emergency, utility, and planning teams
- A platform that allows citizens to engage with live civic data

---

## Key Metrics of Success
- ⏱️ 25–40% improvement in emergency response time
- 🔍 80% real-time event classification accuracy
- 💬 70+ NPS from public sector operators
- 📉 Reduction in redundant dispatches and miscommunications

---

## Strategic Fit
Aligned with global trends in:
- Smart Cities & Urban Resilience (e.g., UN SDG 11)
- GovTech modernization and digital public infrastructure
- Data-driven public policy and urban analytics
