# 📄 Product Requirements Document (PRD) – TrustBridge

## Product Name  
TrustBridge – Blockchain-Powered Data Transfer Integrity Platform

## Owner  
Karthik Mohan

## Version  
v1.0

---

## Objective  
To provide enterprise teams with a zero-trust compliant, tamper-proof way to log, trace, and verify data transfers — through CLI tools, APIs, and blockchain-backed receipts.

---

## Background  
Today’s enterprise data environment is distributed, multi-cloud, and inter-team. While access control is improving, post-access transfer events are opaque. Enterprises need **forensic auditability** and **provable transfer logs** for high-value or regulated data.

TrustBridge introduces **policy-driven transfer logging with on-chain anchoring**, closing the trust gap without disrupting existing infrastructure.

---

## Target Users

- CISOs, Security Architects, and Risk Officers  
- DevSecOps & Platform Engineers  
- Compliance & Audit Teams  
- Data Engineering & ML Infrastructure Leads

---

## MVP Scope

| Feature | Description | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| CLI Tool | Developers can initiate, track, and log transfers | Must Have |
| SHA256 Hash Generator | File hashes are created per transaction | Must Have |
| Blockchain Anchor | Transfer metadata + hash written to ledger (e.g., Fabric/Hedera) | Must Have |
| JSON Receipt Export | Downloadable proof-of-transfer for audit use | Should Have |
| Dashboard UI | View real-time logs, export by policy or date | Could Have |
| API Webhook Hooks | Developers can register events programmatically | Should Have |

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- CLI latency < 3s from trigger to ledger write  
- Ledger integrity must be independently verifiable  
- Supports federated ledger structure in later versions  
- Encryption of metadata in motion and at rest (AES256)

---

## Design Philosophy

- Minimal changes to DevOps pipelines (opt-in CLI or webhook)  
- No centralized “platform lock” — enterprise controls keys  
- Fully auditable, exportable logs (JSON, CSV)  
- Plug-and-play with common data pipelines and storage layers

---

## Success Metrics

- 🧾 ≥95% of tracked transfers generate valid hash + ledger entry  
- 🛠️ Integration with ≥3 enterprise systems in pilot (e.g., Git, GCS, Azure Blob)  
- 🧑‍💼 Audit team satisfaction score ≥ 80  
- 📉 SLA conflict incidents reduced by ≥30%

---

## Known Constraints

- Integration with sensitive internal platforms may require legal + IT clearance  
- Hash-based tracking may not suit binary streams or large media transfers  
- Must avoid “blockchain bloat” — consider anchor compression & metadata optimization

---

## Release Plan

| Milestone | Target Date |
|-----------|-------------|
| CLI & Webhook MVP | Month 1 |
| Blockchain Write Integration (Testnet) | Month 2 |
| JSON Export + Dashboard (Alpha) | Month 3 |
| Pilot with 2 internal systems | Month 4 |
| External Partner API (Beta) | Month 5

> TrustBridge brings forensic certainty to every transfer — without disrupting how engineers work.
