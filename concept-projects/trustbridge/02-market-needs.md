# 📊 Market Needs – TrustBridge

## 📉 Core Pain Points in the Enterprise

- **Data movement is a blind spot.** Files, models, and datasets cross environments with minimal traceability.
- **Zero trust stops at access control.** Most enterprise policies ensure *who* can request data — but not *how* it's moved and tracked.
- **Traditional audit logs aren’t tamper-proof.** SIEM tools and cloud trail logs are mutable, siloed, and disconnected from data lineage.
- **Compliance burden is increasing.** Global regulations (SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR, etc.) now demand traceable, exportable, and verifiable logs — not just “good faith” governance.

## 🧑‍💼 Enterprise Stakeholders

| Role | Challenge | What They Need |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **CISO** | Cannot verify trust post-facto | Immutable, auditable handoff records |
| **Security Architect** | Blind to cross-org or cloud file hops | Chain-of-custody metadata + visibility |
| **Compliance Officer** | Needs proof during audit | JSON receipts, policy enforcement trail |
| **Data Engineer** | Transfers datasets for modeling | Simple, trackable interface (CLI, SDK) |
| **Legal Counsel** | Needs to resolve data breach blame | Verifiable logs that hold up in court |

## 🛠️ Competitor & Tool Landscape

| Tool | Focus | TrustBridge Advantage |
|------|-------|------------------------|
| **AWS CloudTrail / Azure Monitor** | Access and activity logs | Not immutable, lacks external visibility |
| **SIEM Tools (Splunk, Datadog)** | Security alerting and anomaly detection | Not purpose-built for movement lineage |
| **Data Catalogs (Collibra, Alation)** | Metadata governance | Do not track transfer events or chain-of-custody |
| **MFT / SFTP Products** | Secure file transfer | No ledger or zero-trust enforcement |
| **Zscaler / Netskope** | Secure edge/cloud access | Not transfer-proofing or hash-based tracking |
