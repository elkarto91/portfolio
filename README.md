### 🧭 About Me

I'm a technical product leader who builds systems that scale — and matter. From decentralized identity to AI-powered document automation, I’ve led engineering and product delivery for real-world platforms used by global enterprises.

I believe in products that align technology with purpose. This portfolio brings together the strategy, systems, and thought processes that shape my work.
