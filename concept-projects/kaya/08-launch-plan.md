# 🚀 Launch Plan – Kaya

Kaya’s public release will be quiet, intentional, and community-first. Unlike traditional app launches, Kaya will avoid hype, gamification, or social virality — favoring safety, softness, and consent-based growth.

## 🎯 Launch Goals

- Position Kaya as a **companion**, not a product  
- Onboard first 500 users via **referral or community invitation**  
- Partner with **grief support organizations and therapists** for guidance  
- Protect emotional safety while building brand trust

> Kaya’s launch is not about traction — it’s about **trust, tone, and truth**. Every interaction must feel like consent, not conversion.
