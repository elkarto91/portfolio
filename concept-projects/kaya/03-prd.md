# 📄 Product Requirements Document (PRD) – Kaya

## Product Name  
Kaya – AI Grief & Memory Companion

## Owner  
Karthik Mohan

## Version  
v1.0

---

## Objective  
To build a private, AI-powered space that helps users navigate grief through memory interaction, sentiment-aware journaling, and ritualized emotional reflection.

---

## Background  
While mental health and wellness products have grown rapidly, most remain utility-focused or therapy-adjacent. Few address the deeply personal, nonlinear, and private nature of grief. Kaya provides a gentler alternative — one that listens, remembers, and helps shape space for healing.

---

## Target Users

- Adults 25–60 navigating recent or long-term grief
- Caregivers (pre-loss or post-loss)
- Individuals experiencing pet loss, miscarriage, or silent grief
- People who prefer private, asynchronous, and non-judgmental support

---

- Silent mode for passive use (no prompts)

---

## UX & Design Goals

- Soft color palette, poetic UI copy, non-triggering visuals

---

## Known Constraints

- Ethical design: AI must not try to interpret “grief stages” or simulate deceased  
- AI must avoid advice-giving or psychological diagnosis  
- No data monetization — strictly non-commercial use posture
