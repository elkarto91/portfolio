# 📄 Business Case – Kaya

## Product Name  
Kaya – AI Grief & Memory Companion

## Objective  
To provide a private, AI-powered emotional support space for individuals navigating grief through memory interaction, gentle dialogue, and journaling.

---

## Problem

- Grief is isolating, nonlinear, and deeply personal — yet underrepresented in digital products.
- Most mental wellness apps prioritize productivity, mindfulness, or therapy.
- Social media is too public and performative for real emotional processing.
- No safe, private, and intentional space exists for guided memory and grief expression.

---

## Opportunity

- Growing openness toward mental health and emotional tools.
- Underserved segment: those grieving loss of loved ones, pets, miscarriages, or long-term illness.
- Rising adoption of AI chatbots for self-reflection, journaling, and wellness.
- Memory tech (journals, legacy storytelling, digital archives) is converging with personal AI.

---

## Proposed Solution: Kaya

Kaya is a grief-focused, AI-enabled product that blends:

- 📓 Memory Journaling  
- 🎙️ Voice-assisted storytelling prompts  
- 🧠 Sentiment-aware AI conversations  
- 📘 Legacy storybook exports  
- 🔒 Privacy-first, non-networked UX

---

## Differentiators

- Focuses on emotion-first use case (grief), not general wellness  
- Avoids prescriptive therapy tone — instead offers presence and ritual  
- Built with ethical AI guardrails and passive-only prompts  
- Designed for warmth, silence, and minimalism

---

## Success Outcomes

- Help users create space for emotional reflection without exposure  
- Enable rituals of healing through daily interactions  
- Offer continuity for those grieving alone, in silence, or with family

> Kaya is not a solution for grief — it’s a companion that makes space for it.
